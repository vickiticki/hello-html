      Leonardo di Ser Piero da Vinci was born in Vinci, a small town outside
      Florence, on April 15, 1452. He was the illegitimate son of a notary,
      Piero da Vinci, and a peasant, Caterina di Meo Lippi. He lived during the
      Italian High Renaissance. He was a popular artist in his day, and since
      his death has become one of the most famous artists in history. He created
      two of the most famous paintings in the world,
      <em>Mona Lisa</em> and <em>The Last Supper</em>. His
      <em>Salvator Mundi</em> (as of this writing) holds the record for most
      expensive painting ever sold at a public auction. Of course, he is also
      very well known for his numerous

      But Leonardo was far more than just a painter. In fact, he finished rather
      few paintings compared to other artists of his era, mostly due to the fact
      he was constantly distracted by other things. His list of jobs included:

    <ul>
      <li>Sculptor</li>
      <li>Inventor</li>
      <li>Engineer</li>
      <li>Architect</li>
      <li>Musician</li>
      <li>Scientist</li>
      <li>Anatomist</li>
      <li>Geologist</li>
      <li>and more...</li>
