    <h2>Introduction to Leonardo</h2>
    <p>
      Leonardo di Ser Piero da Vinci was born in Vinci, a small town outside
      Florence, on April 15, 1452. He was the illegitimate son of a notary,
      Piero da Vinci, and a peasant, Caterina di Meo Lippi. He lived during the
      Italian High Renaissance. He was a popular artist in his day, and since
      his death has become one of the most famous artists in history. He is
      responsible for two of the most famous paintings in the world,
      <em>Mona Lisa</em> and <em>The Last Supper</em>. His
      <em>Salvator Mundi</em> (as of this writing) holds the record for most
      expensive painting ever sold at a public auction. Of course, he is also
      very well known for his numerous unfinished projects.

      But Leonardo was far more than just a painter. In fact, he finished rather
      few paintings compared to other artists of his era, mostly due to the fact
      he was constantly distracted by other things. His list of jobs included:
